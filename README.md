# EY-CAFTA
For optimal investment strategy, Python can be used to maximize the returns, and reduce the risk and chances of exposure.

Python is one of the best tools for application of optimization theory. Variables, such as, return rates and investment products were provided to the Python program.
Random initial weights were provided, and program gave the most optimized weight distribution as output.
We used the Modern Portfolio theory with the help of library PyPortfolioOpt().
The key components of our model (used in optimization) were: Weight matrix Covariance matrix , Volatility or Standard deviation (risk), Sharpe ratio, Efficient frontier theory and Annual return.

The POWERBI Dashboard and Excel sheet with the allocation are uploaded in the repository.
